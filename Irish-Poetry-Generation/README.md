### Irish Poetry Generation

Poetry Generation is a Deep Learning model which trains your model on any song, poetry. It further accepts few words as
 an input and then generates the poetry following those words.
The training data has been downloaded from Laurence Moroney's blog-spot.
We are implementing Irish Poetry Generation as an example in this project.
