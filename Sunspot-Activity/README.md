### SunSpot Activity Prediction

This project focuses on building a Sequence model for predicting the solar cycle. To know more about Solar Cycle visit

 This Deep Learning model uses training data from Laurence Moroney's Blog-spot. 
 The training data has been preprocessed and then trained on a model which is a combination of LSTM, Conv1D and Lambda 
 Layer. Huber Loss is used as loss function and SGD is used as an optimizer.
 To check the accuracy of the model we have implemented MAE.
